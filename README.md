This repo will contain my experiment about language modeling, one of the most interesting tasks on Natural Language Processing. Just do it for fun and curiosity. Mostly, I use PyTorch, fastai transformers library as the main tools, but I'd look for fairseq library, which seems interesting for language modeling.
